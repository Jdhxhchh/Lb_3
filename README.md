1)Identify Entities and Attributes:
Determine the entities involved in your system. In this case, you have identified Product, Cart, and Order.
Define the attributes for each entity. For example, Product has id, name, and price.

2)Create Class Skeletons:
For each entity, create a Java class with the necessary attributes, constructor, and getter/setter methods.

3)Define Functionality:
Think about what functionality each class should have. For instance, the Cart class should be able to add and remove products.

4)Implement Business Logic:
Write the actual code to implement the business logic. For example, in the Cart class, you would have methods like addProduct, removeProduct, and getProducts.

5)Create a Main Class:
Develop a main class, in this case, ECommerceSystem, to showcase how your classes interact. This class can contain sample code demonstrating the use of your entities and their interactions.

6)Test Cases:
Write test cases using JUnit to verify that your classes and methods work as expected. Test various scenarios, such as adding/removing products, placing orders, and checking order status.

7)Refactoring and Improvements:
Refactor your code for readability and maintainability.
Consider additional features or improvements to enhance your e-commerce system.

8)Documentation:
Add comments to explain complex sections of your code.
Document the purpose of each class and method.
